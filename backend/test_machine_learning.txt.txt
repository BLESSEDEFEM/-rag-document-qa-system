Machine Learning Applications

Machine learning is transforming various industries through automation 
and intelligent decision-making. In healthcare, ML algorithms analyze 
patient data to predict disease outcomes and recommend treatments.

In finance, machine learning models detect fraudulent transactions and 
assess credit risk. These systems learn from historical data to identify 
patterns and make accurate predictions.

Natural language processing, a subset of ML, enables computers to 
understand and generate human language. This technology powers chatbots, 
translation services, and sentiment analysis tools.
